## 🧠 What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that uses algorithms called **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. These networks can **automatically learn complex patterns** and representations from large datasets, especially in unstructured data like images, audio, text, and video.

## 🏗️ Key Idea

Unlike traditional machine learning, where feature engineering is manual, **Deep Learning models learn features hierarchically** — from low-level edges to high-level concepts — directly from raw data.

---

## 🔍 Why is it called "Deep"?

The term *"deep"* refers to the number of layers in the neural network. A deep neural network has **multiple hidden layers**, which allows it to model complex and nonlinear relationships.

## 📈 Growth of Deep Learning

Deep Learning became popular due to:
- **Availability of large datasets (Big Data)**
- **Increased computational power (GPUs, TPUs)**
- **Advancements in algorithms and open-source frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow)**

---

## 🧩 Key Applications

- **Computer Vision** – Image classification, object detection, facial recognition  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Text translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots  
- **Speech Recognition** – Voice assistants, transcription tools  
- **Healthcare** – Disease diagnosis, drug discovery  
- **Autonomous Systems** – Self-driving cars, drones

## ⚙️ Core Components of Deep Learning

| Component              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Neurons**            | Basic computing units inspired by brain cells |
| **Layers**             | Groups of neurons stacked to form the model |
| **Weights & Biases**   | Parameters that are learned during training |
| **Activation Function**| Introduces non-linearity |
| **Loss Function**      | Measures error between predicted and actual output |
| **Optimization**       | Adjusts weights to minimize loss |

## 🔁 Typical Deep Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
2. **Model Architecture Design**
3. **Forward Propagation**
4. **Loss Calculation**
5. **Backpropagation**
6. **Weight Update (Optimization)**
7. **Model Evaluation and Testing**

## 🔢 Example Use Case

A deep learning model for digit recognition (MNIST dataset) would:
- Take a 28x28 grayscale image as input
- Pass it through multiple hidden layers
- Output a probability distribution over digits 0–9
